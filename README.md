## ðŸ§  Overview

This AMBA bridge design enables high-speed AHB masters to communicate with low-speed APB peripherals by converting AHB protocol signals to APB format. It's ideal for SoC designs where performance and power efficiency are balanced through protocol segmentation.

## ðŸ“‚ File Descriptions

| File Name               | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `ahb_master.v`          | AHB master module that initiates read/write transactions. |
| `ahb_slave_interface.v` | Receives transactions from the AHB master and converts them for bridge use. |
| `apb_controller.v`      | Core APB controller handling signal transitions and control logic. |
| `apb_interface.v`       | Generates APB protocol signals and drives data to APB peripherals. |
| `bridge_top.v`          | Top-level integration module connecting AHB and APB logic. |
| `top_tb.v`              | Testbench simulating full end-to-end operation of the bridge. |
